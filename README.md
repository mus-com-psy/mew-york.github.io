Music Enterprise Works York (pronounced "mew York") is responsible for launching and hosting two commercial projects that have grown out of research conducted in the [Music Computing and Psychology Lab](https://tomcollinsresearch.net), [Dept. of Music](https://www.york.ac.uk/music/) at [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/):

* [Discover Music](https://discover-music.glitch.me);
* [Unmix+](https://unmix.glitch.me).

This site also links to code repositories that may be of interest to people looking to get into music/audio programming. These repos have been developed via meetings of the [Music Coding Collective](https://tomcollinsresearch.net/recently.html#mcc), [Dept. of Music]() at [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/music/):

* [Collective hacks](https://github.com/mew-york/collective-hacks);
* [AI Song Contest 2021](https://github.com/mew-york/ai-song-contest-2021). Listen to and read more about the entry [here](https://ai-circus.glitch.me).
